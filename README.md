## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- TypeScript
- Vite
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I have used TypeScript, React & TailwindCSS for this project. Most challenging part was positioning the illustration and its elements. To solve this part I added both the illustration and the background in a `div` and added the property `overflow: hidden`. Then gave the box `position: absolute` and positioned it at the required position.

### Continued development

Need to add animation when revealing Accordion content & add animation to the box to give it hover effect.

### Useful resources
